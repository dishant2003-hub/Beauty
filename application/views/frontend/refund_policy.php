Cancellation for all future recurring billing may be requested in accordance with Section - "Cancellation" under terms of services.

((SITE_NAME)) will not issue refunds by cash, cheque, money transfer or other means of payment. The refund will be processed immediately by ((SITE_NAME)), but depending on the payment method used in the original transaction, depositing the funds may take 3-5 business days.</p>

                           ((SITE_NAME)) is not to be held accountable for the loss or inability to receive e-mails, invoices, receipts, terminations and other important messages on behalf of the subscriber. It is the sole responsibility of the subscriber to provide a legitimate and fully functional e-mail address that can ensure all e-communications on behalf of ((SITE_NAME)) are received, read and not sent to the spam or ”junk mail” folder. E-mail providers such as Hotmail and Gmail are less reliable when it comes to acknowledging e-mails issued by ((SITE_NAME)). Therefore we recommend using an alternative provider when signing up to ((SITE_NAME)).
