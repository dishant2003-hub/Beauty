                              <p>Random runs ((SITE_NAME)) website (in text “Website”) and all services (“Service”) connected to the Random. These Terms and Conditions address specifically the access and use of the service. By purchasing and/or accessing the aforementioned service you comply expressly with the Terms and Conditions specified herein. An on-going membership is provided at ((SITE_NAME)).
                                  Your membership is automatically renewed following a trial period of 5 days, and then every 30 days you will be charged the full membership price of €69.00 or the equivalent in local currency, specified under “Pricing by country”. Memberships run automatically until you actively cancel you membership. No binding period applies, which means it can be terminated at any time.
                                  When signing up for a membership through any of our ongoing campaigns you agree to let ((SITE_NAME)) cancel the promotional trial period price and charge the regular 30-day subscription rate from the credit card that was used when signing up for the service. When purchasing a subscription, it will automatically be renewed every 30-day until you decide to terminate it. To own a valid subscription on ((SITE_NAME)) you must be at least 18 years old and be a resident in one of our operating countries. No hidden fees will be charged when signing up and you can terminate the subscription at any moment before the end of the 5 day trial period.
                                  Should the customer’s credit card reject the subscription charge, the same credit card will later be charged the same amount until payment is registered successfully.
                                  Rejected payments are charged again upon monthly subscription renewal. Continuous rejected payments that last over 6 months will result in immediate subscription termination and access to ((SITE_NAME)) will be closed.
                                  Random reserves the right to issue both digital and physical invoices if an order is not completed through credit card payment. Invoices may be issued by a third party in accordance with Random’s legal right to use so called factoring methods. The customer also understands and accepts that in this here agreement all electronic and telephonic communications between the mentioned parties are in accordance with RPL § 154a.
                                  An order and payment confirmation will be sent to the E-mail stated by the customer upon registration.
                              </p>
